  According to ***Map 1*** and ***Map 2*** the areas with the most 311 noise complaints were Upper West Side and Upper East Side Manhattan. Other prominent areas that recieved a high volume of 311 noise complaints were Lower East Side and areas of Harlem. The reason for these trends can be further explained by looking at ***Map 3***, which depicts population of the NTA's in Manhattan. This map is a quantile gradinet and it shows that areas like Upper west and East Side; Lower East Side, and Harlem have high instances of population density. This means more residential buildings are in those areas and it is prone to experience disturbances in which 311 calls are generated.

 Other trends include specified descriptions and their relevancy in and around Manhattan. According to ***Map 1*** the most prominent 311 noise complaint was in realtion to loud music. This had no particular correlation to population but what could be seen is the absence of 311 reports pretaining to Central Park, meaning there are far fewer disturbances. Noise due to construction was reported heavily in more population dense areas, probably due to the large scale housing complexes and buildings in the city.

The additional data brought in is depicted in ***Map 3***, this is NTA populations for New York in 2020. This data was then trimmed to only show Manhattan's population and then it was depicted as a gradient map for legibility. This renforced my initial insights that the 311 noise complaints would be directly associated with large scale residential housing, but since it was not open data accessable, NTA population was able to substitute. The NTA population for Mnahattan might have been more insightful due to the complications of vaccant housing. But the trends between the data maps are: the higher the population of an area the more 311 calls would be made from that specific area.
