According to ***Map 1*** and ***Map 2*** the areas with the most 311 noise complaints were Upper West Side and Upper East Side Manhattan. Other prominent areas that recieved a high volume of 311 noise complaints were Lower East Side and areas of Harlem. The reason for these trends can be further explained by looking at ***Map 3***, which depicts population of the NTA's in Manhattan. This map is a quantile gradinet and it shows that areas like Upper west and East Side; Lower East Side, and Harlem have high instances of population density. This means more residential buildings are in those areas and it is prone to experience disturbances in which 311 calls are generated.
